# mouse pointer 
## (using pyuatogui, time & random in python)
this program turns the mouse into always moving so that your computer screen never falls to auto-sleep
this way you can stay active withhout actually staying active lmao

remember when you went for a break and left your computer hanging
and it slept which showed youre inactive!
 well not anymore, you will stay all day active on MS Teams so
 thats a plus point
